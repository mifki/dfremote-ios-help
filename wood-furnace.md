A wood [furnace](furnaces.html) is used to convert wood into ash or charcoal. It must be built out of fire-safe materials.

Building a wood furnace requires the architecture skill and a skill relevant to the material used to make the furnace (masonry for stone or glass or any of the metalworking skills for metal).
