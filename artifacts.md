title: Artifacts

Dwarves in [strange moods](strange-mood.html) will create legendary artifacts: unique, "named" items which are of unsurpassable [quality](quality.html) (and often value as well). Dwarves that create an artifact immediately gain enough experience to boost them to legendary level in the affected skill, unless they were possessed.

Artifacts cannot be traded, but most can be used just like any item of its type.
