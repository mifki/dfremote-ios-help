---

Potash is created from ash or lye at an [ashery](ashery.html) by a dwarf with the potash making labor enabled. Potash can be used to fertilize a [farm plot](farm-plot.html), to increase stack size of harvested plants, or be refined into pearlash.

Potash comes in bars, stored in a bar stockpile and viewable in the stocks screen under "bars".
