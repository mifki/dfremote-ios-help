The process of engraving [smoothed](smoothing.html) walls and floors increases their value further, and gives them a [quality](quality.html) level. Engravings made with a quality of well-crafted and higher will usually be in reference to previous events. Unlike furniture, engravings won't give passing dwarves happy thoughts.

Engraving is done using Engrave Stone [designation](designations.html).

#### Toggling

Engravings can either be obscured or not obscured. If they are not obscured, the tile used to draw the engraved wall or floor will attempt to represent the content of the engraving. If they are obscured, they will look similar to smoothed stone.

While playing, one can designate engravings to be toggled using Toggle Engravings [designation](designations.html).
