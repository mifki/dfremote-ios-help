title: Constructions

Constructions are buildings such as floors, walls, and stairs. They can be made of any solid material, including wood, stone, metal, glass, and even [soap](soap.html).

Constructed features cannot be smoothed, engraved, or carved into minecart tracks. In order to construct smooth stone walls and floors, [blocks](block.html) need to be used in place of raw stone.

The "Wall/Floor Construction" labor is required to make constructions, and "construction removal" labor to remove them.
