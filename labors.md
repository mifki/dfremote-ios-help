At the most basic level, labor is how you get things done. When you want your dwarf to do a job of work you must assign that dwarf to a "labor" type that corresponds with the job. You, as the fortress overseer, create jobs to be done by designating them, and the dwarves who have been assigned the corresponding labor type appropriate to the job will complete the job.

For certain jobs, such as mining in our example, a tool is also required for the job to be completed. Miners need picks, Wood cutters need an axe, and Hunters need a crossbow. If a labor needs a tool, the labor is considered exclusive such that you can only assign one of the three labors listed to any single Dwarf. Additionally, the assignment of these tools overrides any uniform assigned to a dwarf's squad, so military dwarves should never be assigned any of the aforementioned labors.
