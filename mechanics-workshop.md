title: Mechanic's workshop
---

A mechanic's workshop is a [workshop](workshops.html) which produces [mechanisms](mechanism.html) out of stone. It is also used to construct traction benches.

Traction benches require a rope (produced in Clothier's shop), or a chain (produced in Metalsmith's forge), a table, and a mechanism.
