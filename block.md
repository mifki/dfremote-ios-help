A block is a type of building material and is more architecturally efficient than their non-processed counterparts. One rock boulder can be shaped into 4 rock blocks, which are lighter, faster building, and more valuable. This makes blocks especially useful for large construction projects.

<!-- Stone, wood, glass, ceramic, and metal blocks can be created respectively in a [mason's workshop](masons-workshop.html), a [carpenter's workshop](carpenters-workshop.html), a glass furnace, a [kiln](kiln.html), and a forge. -->

Ceramic blocks are called a "bricks", though they behave the same as all other blocks.
