A block is a type of building material and more architecturally efficient than their non processed counterparts. One rock boulder can be shaped into 4 rock blocks, which are lighter, faster building, and more valuable. This makes blocks especially useful for large construction projects.

Stone, wood, glass, ceramic, and metal blocks can be created respectively in a mason's workshop, a carpenter's workshop, a glass furnace, a kiln, and a forge. Ceramic blocks are called a "bricks", though they behave the same as all other blocks.
