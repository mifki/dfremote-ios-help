title: Alert Levels
---

In each alert level, you can program instructions for your military and/or civilian dwarves to follow. The game contains two alert levels by default â€” *Inactive* and *Active/Train*. In *Inactive*, all squads are assigned no orders. In *Active/Train*, all squads are supposed to be assigned to train the entire year.

Alerts are created and managed on the Military screen.


#### Civilian Alert

A civilian alert will automatically confine all non-military dwarves to the burrows defined in the alert for as long as the alert is active. When you set the civilian alert level to an alert that includes a defined burrow, your civilian dwarves will ignore their normal burrow-based job restrictions even if their burrow is one of those in the civilian alert.
