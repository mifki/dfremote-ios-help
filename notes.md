* It's up to you to know the address of your computer, and to configure your router for external access if needed (Remote uses UDP port `1235`). We can not guarantee that the built-in publishing / NAT traversal functionality will work with your internet connection. Feel free to contact us for assistance though.

<!-- * If you want to see the game UI while Remote is active, type `remote unhideui`. But you won't be able to move the map and must not perform any actions, e.g. switch to other screens, change side menus and so on.-->

### Major Missing Stuff

Routes, hauling, workshop profiles, stockpile-workshop links.
        
### Other Known Issues
        
* Only two top levels of settings available for stockpiles.
* Designation priorities and automining are not supported.
* Embarks larger than 5 embark tiles are not supported.
* No creature graphics.
* Other minor things here and there that should not significantly affect gameplay.
