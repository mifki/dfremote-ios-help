* It's up to you to know the address of your computer, and to configure your router for external access if needed (Remote uses UDP port `1235`). I can not guarantee that the built-in publishing / NAT traversal functionality will work with your internet connection. Feel free to contact me for assistance though.

* If you want to see the game UI while Remote is active, type `remote unhideui`. But you won't be able to move the map and must not switch to other screens, change side menus, etc.

### Major Missing Stuff

Military screen, workshop profiles, stockpile-workshop links, health overview screen, justice-related stuff, civilizations screen, points/routes/notes, hauling.</p>
        
### Other Known Issues
        
* Only top level settings available for stockpiles.
* Designation priorities and automining are not supported.
* Other things I forgot to mention.
