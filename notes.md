<!-- ### Known Application Issues

Due to a delay caused by the App Store review process, the current version has the following notable bugs:

* Crash when closing designations/buildings menu with Close button - select a designation and cancel it to avoid the crash.
* Some users reported that the map stays black after connecting to a server, but buttons and menus work. Reportedly, this can be fixed by going to Settings menu and choosing a tileset (even if thereâ€™s only the default one in the list).
* May crash if you press Confirm button on some of the screens (military-related) without selecting an item. Use back button to return without making a selection. -->

### Major Missing Stuff

Routes, hauling, stockpile-workshop links. Embark site location chooser is limited.
        
### Other
        
* Designation priorities are not supported
* [0.43] Job image specification is not fully supported</li>
* [0.43] Manager order conditions, per-workshop manager orders are not supported</li>
* [0.43] Engraving designation image specification is not supported</li>
* Embarks larger than 5 embark tiles are not supported
* No creature graphics
* Other minor things here and there that should not significantly affect gameplay

### Connection Notes

* It's up to you to know the address of your computer, and to configure your router for external access if needed (Remote uses UDP port `1235`). We can not guarantee that the built-in publishing / NAT traversal functionality will work with your internet connection. Feel free to contact us for assistance though.

<!-- * If you want to see the game UI while Remote is active, type `remote unhideui`. But you won't be able to move the map and must not perform any actions, e.g. switch to other screens, change side menus and so on.-->
