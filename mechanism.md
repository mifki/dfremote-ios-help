title: Mechanism

Building traps, levers, pressure plates, and gear assemblies requires one mechanism. Linking objects to a lever or pressure plate requires two mechanisms per linked item - one for the linked object, and one for the trigger. Mechanisms can be linked to objects at any distance and do not require a connection between them.

Mechanisms for use in magma must be [magma safe](magma-safe.html), otherwise they will be destroyed (whether by melting or by burning) and the object to which they are linked will deconstruct.

Mechanisms count as furniture. Mechanism [quality](quality.html) determines the skill with which the weapon is "swung" or "fired" by the weapon trap, and affects all the rolls. It does not affect how quickly a trap refires or the probability of the trap jamming.

Mechanisms can be created at a Mechanic's workshop out of a stone, or at a Metalsmith's forge out of [weapons-grade metal](weapon-metal.html). Making metal mechanisms still requires the Mechanics labor.
