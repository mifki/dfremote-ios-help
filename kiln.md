A kiln is a specific type of [furnace](furnaces.html). At a kiln, the order to collect clay from clay collection zones is given. All of the clay/porcelain items (such as bricks, jugs, large pots, statues, and crafts) are made here. Pearlash (for clear and crystal glass) from potash and plaster powder from gypsum, alabaster, selenite or satinspar are also made here. Fuel is required and the Furnace operator skill is used for pearlash and plaster production.

All ceramic products require fuel and use the Potter skill, except for Collect Clay, which requires the Item Hauling labor. For plaster powder production, an empty bag is required.

Glazing of earthenware also happens here, requiring either ash or cassiterite.

Calcium carbonate stone may be processed into [quicklime](quicklime.html) at a kiln (requires Smelting labor).

Building a kiln requires a dwarf with the architecture labor enabled, after which construction will be completed by a mason or metalsmith, depending on the material used.
