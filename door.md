Doors are a piece of furniture used mainly to control the movement of dwarves, pets and liquids and define the exits of rooms. A door must be built next to a wall or other form of support.

<!-- Doors can be made of stone, metal, glass, and wood. Artifact doors can also be made from gem and bone. While stone, wood, and glass doors require only a single building material, metal doors require 3 bars to produce. -->

### Usage

A door has three main settings:

**Forbid Passage**: The door can not be passed unless it is permitted again or destroyed. Dwarves, animals, both wild and tame, and most invaders will all be unable to pass. However, thieves can pick the locks of forbidden doors, and building destroyers such as trolls will simply smash them down.

**Keep tightly closed**: Animals will not be able to pass through the door, but dwarves and invaders will not be hindered. A dwarf that passes through the door can accidentally let in the animals though.

**Set as internal**: When designating rooms, a door set as internal will not block room expansion.

Doors can also be connected to levers or pressure plates to open on command. Doors also halt the movement of liquids (water and magma) in the manner of floodgates, and can be used in the same ways if a passageway is narrow enough.

### Notes

* Any item on the same tile as a door will cause the door to be propped open, which makes it impossible to lock and will allow fluids in. Such will also jam mechanically linked doors, needing to be cleared out and the lever or pressure plate triggered again to shut.
* Doors destroy any fluid on their tile when they close.
* If invaders move past a door, they will take control of the door and you will be unable to issue it qommands. If you can successfully move a squad through a door, it will be retaken, but the door will be returned in an unforbidden state. A door set to be tightly-closed will remain tightly closed when you retake it.
* Artifact doors are indestructible by building destroyers.
