title: Bowyer's workshop
---

The bowyer's workshop is used to make wooden or bone crossbows. It requires any stone, wood or block to build. Take note that the entire left column of the workshop is composed of impassable tiles, making it easy to accidentally trap dwarves inside the workshop after it is built.
