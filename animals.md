title: Animals
---

This screen shows a list of all animals that are owned by the fortress or its residents, but does not include any wild animals in the region, nor animals belonging to invaders or caravans.

* Dogs can be trained for war or hunting. For animals marked for training, a specific trainer may be chosen.
* Animals (except for cats) can be made available or unavailable for adoption. Pets can provide happiness to their owners. Cats will adopt an owner at their whim.
* Unowned animals can be butchered for meat, bones, skin, etc.
* Named animals are often a result of being named before joining your fortress, and usually means they are owned by an immigrant. Named animals may also have made a kill.
