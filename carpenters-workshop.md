---

A Carpenter's workshop is used by a carpenter to make most types of furniture with the exception of statues. The workshop can also make wooden blocks and items like bins, buckets, crutches, shields, and training weapons. Beds can only be made at a carpenter's workshop.

* Making Animal traps require the Trapping labor, not the Carpentry labor.
