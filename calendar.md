A dwarven year consists of 12 months, each exactly 28 days long. Three months make a season (spring, summer, autumn, winter), and year starts on the first day of spring. You can view the current date on the Status Overview screen.

Months are named after kinds of stones, ore, gems and wood as follows (also showing which caravan arrives each season):

 |  | 
--- | --- | ---
**Spring** | Granite, Slate, Felsite | Elven
**Summer** | Hematite, Malachite, Galena | Human
**Autumn** | Limestone, Sandstone, Timber | Dwarven
**Winter** | Moonstone, Opal, Obsidian | None
