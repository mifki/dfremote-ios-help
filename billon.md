title: Billon
---

Billon is an alloy of equal parts silver and copper.

Two billon bars can be made at a smelter from 1 silver bar and 1 copper bar, which does not create an increase in value. However, eight billon bars can be created by smelting 1 silver-bearing ore and 1 copper-bearing ore. Since tetrahedrite counts as both types of ore, two tetrahedrite nuggets can yield eight bars of billon for a roughly 70% increase in value over smelting the tetrahedrite nuggets separately. This recipe will only be used when no other silver-bearing ores are available to the smelter, otherwise silver nuggets or galena ore will be used as the silver-bearing ore, though tetrahedrite can still serve as the copper-bearing ore.
