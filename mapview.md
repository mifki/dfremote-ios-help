* Press the loupe button to cycle between query building, query unit and look modes.

* Many actions are confirmed either by pressing the green circle (OK) button, or by touching the tile with cursor again. For example, you can touch a tile twice to place a building there.

* Touching the screen with two fingers is another way to show the main menu.

* If you're having troubles precisely placing a building (especially for multi-tile buildings), touch the screen anywhere, hold for a sec and then move finger to move the cursor precisely.

* When placing buildings, press and hold OK button to automatically select item(s) to use without displaying the item selection screeen. Likewise, when selecting a building to link to a lever or trap, press and hold OK to automatically select [mechanisms](mechanism.html) to use.
