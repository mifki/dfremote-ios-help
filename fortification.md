title: Fortification
---

Fortification is a [construction](constructions.html) that allows the passage of projectiles (in and out) and liquids, mist, steam, webs, fire, miasma and smoke, but in theory not creatures, making them an important part in a fortress's defense. An archer must have a skill level of accomplished or higher to shoot through fortifications from a distance; otherwise they must stand directly next to the fortification to shoot through it.

Fortifications can be built one of two ways. Firstly, they can be *carved* from constructed walls or [smoothed](smoothing.html) natural walls by using Carve Fortifications designation. The second way is to *build* them.

Constructed fortifications are open on top - they do not provide a floor for the tile above. This lets water, items and some critters in, until and unless a floor or something else is built one Z-level above, just like over any other empty space. Fortifications carved* out of a wall (whether natural or constructed) are covered - they retain most properties of the original wall, including a floor one level above.

[Bug] Fully submerged (i.e. 7/7 depth) fortifications will not block the passage of creatures that swim in water (or magma) - wall grates and vertical bars work, but they are vulnerable to building destroyers.
