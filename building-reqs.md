title: Building Requirements
---

Most of the buildings require either a corresponding items (furniture, doors) or raw materials (workshops, constructions) to be selected after choosing a location for the building.

Usually only one item is required, but some buildings require several different items, and constructions require amount of materials based on their size. When placing a [weapon trap](weapon-trap.html), you can select any number of weapons (within the limits) to be added to the trap.

You can use the default grouped view, or toggle grouping if you want to choose an item with particular quality or even a specific item.
