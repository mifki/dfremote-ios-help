title: Smoothing
---

Smoothing rough stone is a simple way to increase the value of a room. It is performed using Smooth Stone [designation](designations.html). Smoothed walls are also a prerequisite for carving fortifications.

After a natural stone surface is smoothed, it may be further improved by [engraving](engraving.html).
