Furnace is an umbrella term for different [workshops](workshops.html) that are used to heat materials, and that often produce only intermediary &ndash; products, items that are then used to create something else for the final product.

Jobs at a furnace generally require fuel or, in the case of magma furnaces, the heat from magma - if the latter, they do not use up any magma but merely must be placed over it. Magma furnaces must be placed with one of their edge tiles above magma with depth of 4 or more; this can be accomplished by digging a channel for the magma, or hanging it directly over an open magma source.
