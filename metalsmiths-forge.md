title: Metalsmith's forge
---

The metalsmith's forge is a workshop used by dwarves to turn metal bars into useful objects such as weapons, armor, furniture, coins, ammunition for siege equipment and crossbows, trap components, and other finished goods. To build a forge, you must have fire-safe materials and an anvil. Every use of the forge, except for studding, consumes one unit of fuel (coke or charcoal).
