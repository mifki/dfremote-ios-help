The Ashery is a [workshop](workshops.html) used to make lye, as well as making potash from ash or lye. To build an ashery, you need a [block](block.html), a [barrel](barrel.html), a [bucket](bucket.html), and someone with the potash making or lye making labor enabled.

Lye is one of the main ingredients for [soap](soap.html), which is used for cleaning wounds and the fortress, while potash is used for fertilizing [farms](farm-plot.html), allowing an increased output of plants.
