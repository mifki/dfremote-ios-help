title: Potash
---

Potash is created from ash or lye at an [ashery](ashery.html) by a dwarf with the potash making labor enabled. Potash can be used to fertilize a [farm plot](farm-plot.html), to increase stack size of harvested plants, or be refined into pearlash.

Potash comes in bars, stored in a bar stockpile and viewable in the stocks screen under "bars".

###Potash Production Chain

Wood Stockpile > Wood Furnace produces Ash (as bars) > Ashery produces potash (as bars). Note: 5 bars are stored in a bin. An ashery requires a block, barrel, and bucket as components.
