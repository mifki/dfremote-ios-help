Buildings include furniture, [workshops](workshops.html) and furnaces, constructions, traps, levers and other objects. All buildings (except for Farm Plot) require raw materials or a corresponding items in order to be constructed. Some of them also require size and sometimes other options to be choosen at build time.

#### Actions

A building can be removed anytime to regain all the resources used to build it. [Constructions](constructions.html), like constructed floors, walls, stairs and so on, are removed with `remove construction` [designation](designations.html).
