Forbidding prevents dwarves from using an item or building. To forbid a building, go to list of items it contains and forbid them. The opposite to forbid is reclaim.

To mass forbid or reclaim items, use the appropriate [designation](designations.html) from `Set Building / Item Properties` submenu.
