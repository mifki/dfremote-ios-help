Workshops are [buildings](buildings.html) where materials are processed into more valuable or useful items. They have specific [labors](labors.html) that are required by dwarves to build them or to work there, and dwarves with more of the appropriate skill tend to produce higher [quality](quality.html) objects, and/or produce them faster.
