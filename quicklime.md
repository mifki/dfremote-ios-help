title: Quicklime
---

Quicklime is made from calcium carbonate stones at a [kiln](kiln.html) using the smelting labor. It can be processed into milk of lime at an ashery, which is further used to create parchment.

The reaction needs 1 calcium carbonate stone and 1 unit of fuel except when using a magma kiln. It also needs an empty bag.

<!--Much like certain other entertaining materials, quicklime does not pose any health hazard to your dwarves, and can't be weaponized for its Fun reaction with water.-->
